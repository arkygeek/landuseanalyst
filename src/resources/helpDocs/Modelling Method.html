LandUse Analyst currently offers three types of analysis.  Here you select which one you want to use.</p>
<p>Euclidean method starts looking for suitable land at the site and moves outwards from that point 'as the crow flies'.  In other words, using Euclidean geometry (or even more simply, it draws circles!)</p>
<p>Walking Time method uses the same basic principle except that it moves outward from the site based on walking time instead of distance.  This method is probably the most realistic scenario to run, but it is interesting to compare the results of the three different methods.</p>
<p>Path Distance is very similar to Eucidean, except that this method considers topography when calculating distance from the site.</p>
