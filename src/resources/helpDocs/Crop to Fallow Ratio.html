<tr><td><b>Crop to Fallow Ratio</b></tr></td>
<p>
When crop rotation is used, this field must be set.  If the land grows a crop one year, and is left fallow the next, then the crop to fallow ratio is 1:1 so you would set the value to 1.  For more complicated rotations, such as a cereal-legume-fallow rotation, it gets slightly more complicated.  That situation would be one year out of three fallow and two years out of three crop.  In this case, the setting would be 0.50 which might seem confusing.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, consider a 10 year cycle, with crops for 10 years and fallow for one.that ratio is 10:1  or 1:0.1 right?  So, to reduce the crop to a value of one, which we need to do, you divide it by itself.  This is then repeated for the other value.  So with our 2:1 example in the cereal-legume-fallow scenario, 2 divided by itself is 1.  The fallow value, which is 1 is then also divided by 2, with the result being 0.5!  Easy!</P>
<p>Just remember that you need to <b>divide the <i>number of years of fallow</i> by the <i>number of years of crop</i></b> to set this properly.</p>
