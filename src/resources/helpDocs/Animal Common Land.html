<tr><td><b>Animal Common Land</b></tr></td>
<p>Sometimes land is suitable for grazing by more than one type of animal.  LandUse Analyst allows you to designate one suitability mask as common grazing land.  Note that you can specify an animal to use both common land and specific land at the same time.  If this is the case, equal preference is given to all animals grazing the common land.  This is not always ideal, as it may have been the case that some animals were given preference to the common land if the other suitable land was further away than the other animals using it.</p>
<p>
A workaround for this problem is that LandUse Analyst produces classified maps of the land being used, so if it is the case that you find one animal being forced to travel much further than others, you can simply change settings to balance this.  This can be accomplished by removing the other animals one at a time from using the common grazing land.  It may be the case, however, that there is no ideal solution, and that they simply had to travel the extra distance!</p>
