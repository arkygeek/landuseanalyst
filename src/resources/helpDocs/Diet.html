LandUse Analsyt needs area targets before it can determine landuse for a site.  In order to calculate the area requirements for crops and animals, calorie targets must first be determined.  The Diet section makes this task very straight forward.  It is important to note that all dietary considerations in this program are based on calories (or in some cases KCalories).</p>
<p>  With this in mind, the first step is to define their diets as a ratio between calories provided by <b>Plants</B> and calories provided by <b>Meat</b> with the top slider.  You can either click and drag with the mouse, or use the mouse wheel.  As you slide it, you will see that the percentages for both are automatically adjusted.  This setting includes all sources of the diet.</p>
<p>The second level of adjustment is to set the proportions between tame and wild sources.  This works the same way as the top slider.  Things to consider when setting these sliders are fishing, hunting, wild plant foraging, etc.</p>
