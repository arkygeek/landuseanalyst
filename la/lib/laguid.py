"""

This code defines a LaGuid class in Python using PyQt5.

It provides a globally unique identifier (GUID) to represent a unique instance.
    The GUID is generated using PyQt5's QUuid class. The class has a guid method
    that returns the GUID, and a setGuid method that can be used to set the GUID

The laguid.cpp file defines the implementation of the LaGuid class in C++.

The Python version of the class does not require an implementation file, as the
    GUID is generated using PyQt5's QUuid class.
