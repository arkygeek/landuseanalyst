"""

This code defines a LaGrassProcessLib class in Python using PyQt5.

The class inherits from QObject and defines two methods, process and serialize,
    which are equivalent to the process and serialize methods defined in the
    original lagrassprocesslib.cpp file.

The process method takes an XML string as input and returns a dictionary of
    La objects, while the serialize method takes a dictionary of La objects as
    input and returns an XML string.

lagrassprocesslib.cpp defines implementation of LaGrassProcessLib class in C++.

The Python version of the class does not require an implementation file, as the
    methods are defined in the class definition using decorators.
