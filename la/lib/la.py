la.py - A PyQt5 implementation of the La class.

"""

In this modified code, the contents of la.h are rewritten into PyQt5.

The various enums and typedefs are defined as classes using the Enum and Tuple
    types from the Python standard library.

The La class is defined to contain the various enums and typedefs, and the
    necessary imports are included at the beginning of the file.

A file comment header provides a brief description of the file and its contents.
