<h1>Clone an Animal</h1>
<p>If you want to create a new animal that is similar to one already defined,
  you can clone this animal to save time.</p>
<p>All of the <b>settings</b> of the animal you are cloning are transferred to the new
  clone, but the name is changed to <em>Clone of ...</em> (whatever the name of the animal
  you are cloning was).</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>  the parameters are <u>not</u> transferred.</p>
