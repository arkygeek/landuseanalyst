<h1>Settlement Information</h1>
<div>The information entered here will be inserted as Meta-Data into the maps
  Landuse Analyst will create. This is very useful, as all model settings are
  stored within the maps, so even if things get mis filed, you will always be
  able to look at the meta data embedded into the map and see the exact values
  for every setting in Landuse Analyst when the map was created.</div>
