<h1>Clone a Crop</h1>
<p>If you want to create a new crop that is similar to one already defined, you
  can clone this crop to save time. All of the settings of the crop you are
  cloning are transferred to the new clone, but the name is changed to <em>Clone of ...</em>
  (whatever the name of the crop you are cloning is).
