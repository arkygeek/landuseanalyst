<h1>Numbers</h1>
<p>It is important to point out that many of, if not most, of the numbers
  being used for calculations are estimates, averages, or even guesses. Always
  take a step back and look at all of the values you have supplied before
  running the model and see if they look reasonable. Remember the old saying -
  'Garbage In, Garbage Out' !!!</p>
