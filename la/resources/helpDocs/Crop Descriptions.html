<h1>Crop Descriptions</h1>
<p>In order to enable Landuse Analyst to model any crop, several details must
  be entered to define specific varieties. Crop Manager asks for general
  information about the crop in this section. You might want to have more than
  one strain of the same variety, however, which is allowed.</p>

<p>To define different strains of the same variety is quite easy. Let's say
  you want to have two kinds of wheat for example. The Name: field is Wheat for
  both, but in Notes: field, enter Hard Red for one, and Soft White for the
  other. Then adjust the other parameters as you wish. Even though the name is
  the same, the crop is saved uniquely.</p>
