<h1>Animal Common Land</h1>
<p>Sometimes land is suitable for grazing by more than one type of animal.
	Landuse Analyst allows you to designate one suitability mask as common
	grazing land. Note that you can specify an animal to use both common land
	and specific land at the same time. If this is the case, equal preference
	is given to all animals grazing the common land.</p>

<p>This is not always ideal, as it may have been the case that some animals were
	given preference to	the common land if the other suitable land was further away
	than the other animals using it.</p>
	<p>A workaround for this problem is that Landuse Analyst produces classified
	maps of the land being used, so if it is the case that you find one animal
	being forced to travel much further than others, you can simply change
	settings to balance this. This can be accomplished by removing the other
	animals one at a time from using the common grazing land. <em>It may be the
	case, however, that there is no ideal solution</em>, and that they simply had
	to travel the extra distance!</p>
