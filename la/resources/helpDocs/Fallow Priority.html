<h1>Fallow Priority</h1>
<p>Because some animals may have been given preferential access to the fallow
  land, Landuse Analyst has given three different priority levels to fallow
  access. The software first looks at the HIGH priority animals, and designates
  all fallow land to them, until either their needs are satisfied, or the
  available fallow land is all used.</p>

<p>If there is more than enough fallow land for the HIGH priority animals, the
  remaining amount is then made available to the MED priority animals, and this
  repeats for the LOW priority ones as well.</p>
