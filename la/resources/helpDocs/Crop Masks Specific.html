<h1>Crop Masks Specific</h1>
<p>Sometimes you may want to specify that land is suitable for growing only
  one type of crop. Landuse Analyst allows you to designate a land suitability
  mask as being unique to a certain crop. Note that you can specify a crop to
  use both common land and specific land at the same time. For more detailed
  information on this, see the help section on Crop Masks Common.</p>
