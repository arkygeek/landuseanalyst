<h1>Setting Animal Parameters</h1>
<p>In order to enable Landuse Analyst to model animals, several details must
  be supplied. Animal Parameter Manager asks for these specifics. As with Animal
  Manager, it is possible to have more than one parameter named the same thing.
  Again, just enter a descriptor in the Notes: field.</p>
<p>To define different parameters for the same animal, follow the same
  procedure as for defining multiple animals with the same name. Let's say you
  want to have two parameters set up for Cow as an example. The Name: field is
  Cow for both, but in Notes: field, enter Optimistic for one, and Conservative
  for the other. Then adjust the parameters as you wish for each. Even though
  the name is the same, the parameters are saved uniquely. Having multiple
  parameters can be useful for setting up different scenarios, such as drought
  years, diease, catastrophic events, etc. Eventually, Landuse Analyst will have
  the ability to model over time, and will have these types of scenarios
  incorporated into the model.</p>
