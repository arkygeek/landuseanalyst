<p>Hit the Clear button to erase everything in the Diet Breakdown display
  window. This is useful if you make adjustments and don't want to clutter the
  view. The option to leave the previous data there (by not hitting the clear
  button) is in case the user wants to compare the results of different
  settings.</p>
