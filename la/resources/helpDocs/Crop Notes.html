<h1>Crop Notes</h1>
<p>Because Landuse Analyst allows more than one type of crop to be defined,
  the Notes: field allows you to give a brief description of the the crop. For
  example, you may have two "Wheat" crops defined, and the Notes: fields could
  contain "Hard Red" and "Soft White" to distinguish between them.</p>
