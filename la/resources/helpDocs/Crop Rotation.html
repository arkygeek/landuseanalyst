<h1>Crop Rotation</h1>
<p>If crops were rotated, the checkbox needs to be checked. The variables for
  crop rotation are unavailable until this has been done.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that animals can graze the fallow land. Because of this, you
  will need to estimate what the food value from the fallow land would have
  been, similar to what needs to be done when defining grazing land.</p>
