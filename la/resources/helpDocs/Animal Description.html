<h1>Animal Description</h1>
<p>In order to enable Landuse Analyst to model any animal, several details must
	be entered to define specific types or breeds. Animal Manager asks for general
	information about the animal in this section. You might want to have more than
	one breed of the same species, however, which is allowed.</p>
<p>To define different breeds of the same species is quite easy. Let's say you
	want to have two kinds of cows for example. The Name: field is Cow for both,
	but in Notes: field, enter Dairy for one, and Beast of Burden for the other.
	Then adjust the other parameters as you wish. Even though the name is the
	same, the animal is saved uniquely.</p>
