<h1>Crop Parameter Description</h1>
<p>In order to enable Landuse Analyst to model a crop, several parameters must
  be entered that describe how it was grown and used. Crop Parameter Manager
  asks for this specific information. You might want to have more than one
  parameter of the same name, and again, this is allowed.</div>

<p>To define different parameters of the same name is quite easy. Let's say
  you want to have two parameters defined for wheat for example. The Name: field
  could be Shuna for both, but in Notes: field, enter Optimistic for one, and
  Conservative for the other. Then adjust the other values as you wish. Even
  though the name is the same, the parameter is saved uniquely.</p>
