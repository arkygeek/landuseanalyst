<h1>Saving Animals</h1>
<p>After completing all fields to define an animal, you <b>MUST</b> click the
  Apply button to save it. The name does not have to be unique, as Landuse
  Analyst has a special way of saving animals to allow for duplicate Animal
  names. It is helpful, however, to utilize the Notes field to distinguish
  between same-named animal definitions.</p>
