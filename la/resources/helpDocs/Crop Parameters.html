<h1>Crop Parameters</h1>
<p>In order to enable Landuse Analyst to model crops, several details must be
  supplied. Crop Parameter Manager asks for these specifics. As with Crop
  Manager, it is possible to have more than one parameter named the same thing.
  Again, just enter a descriptor in the Notes: field.</p>
<p>To define different parameters for the same crop, follow the same procedure
  as for defining multiple crops with the same name. Let's say you want to have
  two parameters set up for Wheat as an example. The Name: field is Wheat for
  both, but in Notes: field, enter Optimistic for one, and Conservative for the
  other. Then adjust the parameters as you wish for each. Even though the name
  is the same, the parameters are saved uniquely.</p>

<p>Having multiple parameters can be useful for setting up different scenarios,
  such as drought years, diease, catastrophic events, etc. Eventually, Landuse
  Analyst will have the ability to model over time, and will have these types of
  scenarios incorporated into the model.</p>
