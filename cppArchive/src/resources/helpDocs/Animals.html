<tr><td><b>Animals</b>
<p>
Animals were the most difficult part of the model to get working.  Each animal type being modelled has, potentially, different feed requirements, land requirements, young per litter, etc.  Rather than having to define unique scenarios for each animal, an algorithm was devised which allows for any animal to use just the one model.  This algorithm takes all of the user supplied input about an animal and determines the herd size required to supply the population with the indicated amount of meat, and then calculates how much land would be required to sustain a herd of that size.  Further considerations and adjustments are made to this figure, depending on the diet composition of the animal, but these details are discussed in more detail in other sections of the LandUse Analyst Handbook.
