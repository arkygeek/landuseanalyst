<tr><td><b>Usable Meat</b>
<p>The production targets for animals are in Kg of meat, so to be compatible with animal numbers, you must know the percentage of the animal's live weight that is usable for food.  You can also take into account here the efficiency of the butchering technique that the population used.  In other words, if you believe they were wasteful, this is where you would make an adjustment to integrate that.</p>
