<tr><td><b>Crop Masks Common</b></tr></td>
<p>Sometimes land is suitable for growing more than one type of crop.  LandUse Analyst allows you to designate one suitability mask as common.  Note that you can specify a crop to use both common land and specific land at the same time.  If this is the case, equal preference is given to all crops using the common land.</p>
<p>
A workaround for this problem is that LandUse Analyst produces classified maps of the land being used, so if it is the case that you find one crop extending much further than others, you can simply change settings to balance this.  This can be accomplished by removing the other crops one at a time from using the common grazing land.  It may be the case, however, that there is no ideal solution, and that they simply had to travel the extra distance!</p>
