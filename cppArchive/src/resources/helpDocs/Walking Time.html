<tr><td><b>Walking Time</b>
<p>When Walking Time is selected, a cost map for the area is created that predicts how long it takes to get to any area on the map from the settlement.  The program then calculates the suitable area contained within the time it takes to walk.  If the derived area is insufficient to support the population, the walking time is increased, and it tries again.  This repeats until the required area is contained.  This method is probably the most realistic scenario to run, but it is interesting to compare the results of the three different methods.</p>
