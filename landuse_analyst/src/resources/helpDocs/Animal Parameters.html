<tr><td><b>Animal Parameters</b></tr></td>
<p>In order to enable LandUse Analyst to model animals, several details must be supplied.  Animal Parameter Manager asks for the specific information about the animal which tells the program how the animal was fed, and how big a part of the settlements diet it was.  As with Animal Manager, it is possible to have more than one parameter named the same thing.  Again, just enter a descriptor in the Notes: field.</p>

<p>To define different parameters for the same animal, follow the same procedure as for defining multiple animals with the same name.  Let's say you want to have two parameters set up for cows as an example.  The Name: field is Cow for both, but in Notes: field, enter Optimistic for one, and Conservative for the other.  Then adjust the parameters as you wish for each.  Even though the name is the same, the parameters are saved uniquely.  Having multiple parameters can be useful for setting up different scenarios, such as drought years, diease, catastrophic events, etc.  Eventually, LandUse Analyst will have the ability to model over time, and will ahve these types of scenarios incorporated into the model.</p>
