<h1>Digitizing</h1>
<p>Because future versions of Landuse Analyst will (hopefully) have features
  from QGis embedded into it, we reccommend that you use QGis to create your
  land suitability mask files. QGis is very easy to use, has a great digitizing
  setup, and the results are easily transferred to GRASS with it's built-in
  GRASS plugin.</p>
