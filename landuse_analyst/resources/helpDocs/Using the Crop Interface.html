<h1>Using the Crop Interface</h1>
<p>The crop interface is split into three sections. The top section lists all
  of the crops that have been defined, along with there assigned parameter
  settings. The crop definition is on the left side, and the model parameters
  for the plant are in the right hand section.</p>
<p>To view the settings of a crop, simply click on it above, and it will be
  displayed in the panel to the right of the list. If you need to create new
  crops, or change the settings for a crop, this must be done from the crop
  manager, which is opened by pressing the Manage Crops... button. If you need
  to create new model parameters for a crop, you need to press the Manage Crop
  Parameters... and make the adjustments from there.</p>
