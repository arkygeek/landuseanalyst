<h1>Location</h1>
<p>Where in the world is your site? This is where you tell Landuse Analyst the
  location of your site which is being modelled. <b>It is crucial that the E/N
    coordinates you supply here match those of the land suitability mask files
    you create.</b> If they do not match, the model simply will
  <i><u>not</u></i> work.</p>
