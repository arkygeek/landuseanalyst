<h1>Modelling Method</h1>
<p>Landuse Analyst currently offers three types of analysis. Here you select
  which one you want to use.</p>
<p><b>Euclidean</b> method starts looking for suitable land at the site and moves
  outwards from that point 'as the crow flies' . In other words, using Euclidean
  geometry (or even more simply, it draws circles!)</p>
  <p><b>Walking Time</b> method uses the same basic principle except that it moves
    outward from the site based on walking time instead of distance. This method
    is probably the most realistic scenario to run, but it is interesting to
    compare the results of the three different methods.</p>
    <p><b>Path Distance</b> is very similar to Eucidean, except that this method
      considers topography when calculating distance from the site.</p>
