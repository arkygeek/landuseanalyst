<h1>Death Rate</h1>
<p>Landuse Analyst accommodates for birthing deaths only. If an animal
  survives to weaning age but dies before slaughter, it is not modelled at this
  time. However, you can adjust the death rate setting to indicate the average
  survival rate of births.</p>

<p>This is important for determining herd size, as it
  affects the number of mothers needed to sustain the production levels required
  by the settlement.</p>
