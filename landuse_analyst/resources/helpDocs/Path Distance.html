<h1>Path Distance</h1>
<p>When Path Distance is selected, a cost map for the area is created that
  calculates how far it is to all areas of the map from the site. This is very
  similar to Eucidean, except that path distance considers topography. The
  program then calculates area contained within a certain distance of the site.</p>

<p>If the derived area is insufficient to support the population, the distance is
  increased, and it tries again. This repeats until the required area is
  contained.</p>
