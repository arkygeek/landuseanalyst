<h1>Crop Masks Common</h1>
<p>Sometimes land is suitable for growing more than one type of crop. Landuse
  Analyst allows you to designate one suitability mask as common. <b>Note:</b>
  you can specify a crop to use both common land and specific land at the same time.
  If this is the case, equal preference is given to all crops using the common
  land.</p>
<p>A workaround for this problem is that Landuse Analyst produces classified
  maps of the land being used, so if it is the case that you find one crop
  extending much further than others, you can simply change settings to balance
  this.</p>
<p>This can be accomplished by removing the other crops one at a time from
  using the common grazing land. It may be the case, however, that there is no
  ideal solution, and that they simply had to travel the extra distance!</p>
