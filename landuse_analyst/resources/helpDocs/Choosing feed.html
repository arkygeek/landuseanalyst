<h1>Choosing Feed</h1>
<p>
  Landuse Analyst makes it possible to consider the idea that people were feeding their animals in \
  addition to grazing them.  It is possible to specify a portion of the animals diet as being satisfied
  by either fodder or grain from any of the crops in the model.  The targets for the crops are
  updated to accommodate this.</p>

  <p>Note that the figures are a <b>percentage</b> of the diet (again,
  talking about calories), and <b>not</b> the <em>number</em> of calories.
