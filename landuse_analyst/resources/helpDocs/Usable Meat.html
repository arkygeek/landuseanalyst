<h1>Usable Meat</h1>
<div>The production targets for animals are in Kg of meat, so to be compatible
  with animal numbers, you must know the percentage of the animal's live weight
  that is usable for food. You can also take into account here the efficiency of
  the butchering technique that the population used. In other words, if you
  believe they were wasteful, this is where you would make an adjustment to
  integrate that.</div>
