<h1>Animal Notes</h1>

<p>Because Landuse Analyst allows more than one type of animal to be defined,
  the Notes: field allows you to give a brief description of the the animal. For
  example, you may have two "Sheep" defined, and the Notes: fields could contain
  "For Slaughter" and "Wool Producers" to distinguish between them.</p>
