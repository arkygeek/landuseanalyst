<h1>Using the Animals Interface</h1>
<p>The Animal Interface has been designed to be very simple and easy to use.
  The top section lists all of the defined animals, and selecting one will
  display its settings in the two lower sections. The lower sections are divided
  into the animal definition details on the left, and the model parameter
  settings for the currently selected animal on the right.</p>
<p>If you wish to edit either the animal or its parameters, you simply click
  on the Manage button below the display areas.</p>
