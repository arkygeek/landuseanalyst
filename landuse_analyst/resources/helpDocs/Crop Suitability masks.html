<h1>Crop Suitability Masks</h1>

<p>In order for Landuse Analyst to create landuse maps, you must first create
  land suitability files to tell it what land is suitable for use by the crops
  and the crops. These files can be produced manually or automatically, but at
  the moment both must be done with external tools like QGis or GRASS.</p>

<p>Future versions of Landuse Analyst will have the required features of these
  programs incorporated into it, but for now this step must be done externally. </p>

<h2>Manual Classification</h2>

<p>To create classification maps, you must create binary raster files. These files
  must must be in native GRASS format. The easiest way to do this is to use
  <a href="http://qgis.org/"><u><font color="#0000ff">QGis</font></u></a>.
</p>

<p>Essentially, you load a geo-referenced map or image of the
  area around your site into QGis and then classify it. Classifying is
  simply done by tracing around the land you deem suitable and giving it a
  name. So for example, you might have an area of land that you want to
  classify as being suitable for growing olives. You basically need to
  'paint' or cover all the bits which are suitable, so you might end up with
  several painted bits (polygons).</p>

<b>It is important that polygons do not overlap. Land can only be designated
  for one use in this step!</b>

<p>Overlapping polygons will produce unreliable results. There are ways to
  combine use though. For crops, you can select land that is sutable for
  more than one crop. This is referred to in LanUse Analyst as Common Land.
  For animals, it is called Common Grazing Land.</p>

<h2>Automatic Classification</h2>

<p>This is quite an advanced method, but I will briefly explain how it works.
  It is possible to analyze geo-referenced images to determine soil types,
  current land use, and even basic geology. Typically, high resolution aerial
  photographs or satellite images are used. Then you can use methods such as
  textural or spectral analysis to determine classification.</p>

<p>It is very important to point out that this method is going to classify based only on
  modern day landscapes, and should therefore probably only be used as a tool
  for helping to determine what the paleolandscape was.</p>
