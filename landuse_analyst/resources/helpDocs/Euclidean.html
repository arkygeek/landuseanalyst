<h1>Euclidean</h1>
<p>When Euclidean is selected, a cost map for the area is created that
  calculates how far it is to all areas of the map from the site. This distance
  does NOT consider topography. In other words, it is simply as the crow flies.
  The program then calculates area contained within a certain distance of the
  site. If the derived area is insufficient to support the population, the
  distance is increased, and it tries again. This repeats until the required
  area is contained.</p>
