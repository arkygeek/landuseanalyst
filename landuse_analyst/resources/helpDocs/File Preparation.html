<h1>File Preparation</h1>
<p>For each animal or crop being modelled, land suitability masks must be
  created. The modules to do this will not be implemented into Landuse Analyst
  until future versions. The land suitability mask files must, however, be in
  native GRASS raster format! There is no other format that will work.</p>
