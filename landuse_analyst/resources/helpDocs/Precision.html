<h1>Precision</h1>
<p>Landuse Analyst finds suitable land contained with a boundary around the
  site. This boundary is different for each modelling method, but the process is
  identical. Once this boundary has been determined, it looks inside and
  calcualtes the total area of suitable land and compares it to the Area Target.</p>

<p>If the area of suitable land contained within this boundary falls within the
  range set by Model Precision, it has found the solution. If it is under this
  range, however, the boundary is moved outwards, and the process repeats until
  enough suitable land has been found.</p>
