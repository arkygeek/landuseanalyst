<h1>Crops</h1>
<p>Landuse Analyst comes with five default crops which cannot be modified. The
  definitions of these crops are not to be taken as true. Although reasonable,
  the values used are simply there to give examples as to how crops can be set
  up. In other words, don't use these values without doing your own research to
  back up the numbers you choose! To change these default crops, simply clone
  them, and modify the clones to your hearts content.</p>
