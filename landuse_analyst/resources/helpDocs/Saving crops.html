<h1>Saving Crops</h1>
<p>After completing all fields to define a crop, you <b>MUST</b> click the Apply
  button to save it. The name does not have to be unique, as Landuse Analyst has
  a special way of saving crops to allow for duplicate crop names. It is
  helpful, however, to utilize the Notes field to distinguish between same-named
  crop definitions.</p>
