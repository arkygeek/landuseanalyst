<h1>Animals</h1>
<p>Animals were the most difficult part of the model to get working. Each animal
  type being modelled has, potentially, different feed requirements, land
  requirements,  young per litter, etc. Rather than having to define unique
  scenarios for each animal, an algorithm was devised which allows for any
  animal to use just the one model.</p>

<p>This algorithm takes all of the user supplied input about an animal and
  determines the herd size required to supply the population with the indicated
  amount of meat, and then calculates how much land would be required to
  sustain a herd of that size.</p>

<p>Further considerations and adjustments are made to this figure, depending on
  the diet composition of the animal, but these details are discussed in more
  detail in other sections of the Landuse Analyst Handbook.</p>
