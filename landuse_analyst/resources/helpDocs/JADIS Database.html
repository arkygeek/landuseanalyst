<h1>JADIS Database</h1>
<p>In future versions of Landuse Analyst, we hope to integrate database
  functionality to take advantage of extant databases such as JADIS. This kind
  of integration would make it possible to perform large scale network analysis
  of contemporaneous sites. In this early version, however, the button has no
  function.</p>
