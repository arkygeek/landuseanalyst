<h1>Animal Parameter Notes</h1>
<p>Because Landuse Analyst allows more than one type of parameter to be defined,
  the Notes: field allows you to give a brief description of the the parameter.
  For example, you may have two "Shuna" parameters defined, and the Notes:
  fields could contain "Conservative" and "Optimistic" to distinguish between them.</p>
